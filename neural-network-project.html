      <h2>Neural Network Library Project</h2>
    
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        My inspiration for creating this neural network library stems from my fascination with machine learning and a desire to build on the work I did for my Math 156 Project (available <a href="https://objones25.github.io/resume_files/Math_156_Project.pdf">here</a>). In that project, I explored various machine learning methods for credit card fraud detection. This experience sparked my interest in developing a more efficient neural network implementation that could handle large datasets quickly. I saw this as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of both C++ and machine learning principles.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project is an attempt to create a flexible and efficient neural network library that can be used for various machine learning tasks. The core implementation is in C++ for performance, with Python bindings to make it easily accessible to data scientists and machine learning practitioners.

      <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
      <p>Developing this library has come with its share of challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing backpropagation correctly, especially for complex network architectures with features like batch normalization</li>
        <li>Optimizing performance to handle large datasets efficiently, which involved careful memory management and parallelization considerations</li>
        <li>Dealing with numerical stability issues, particularly in the implementation of activation functions, loss calculations, and gradient computations</li>
        <li>Creating a user-friendly API that is both flexible and intuitive, while bridging the gap between C++ and Python</li>
        <li>Ensuring compatibility between the C++ core and Python bindings, which required a deep understanding of both languages and their interoperability</li>
        <li>Implementing and debugging various optimization algorithms like Adam and RMSprop</li>
        <li>Resolving compilation and linking errors, especially when working with external libraries and different operating systems</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting segmentation faults and memory-related issues in the C++ implementation</li>
        <li>Fine-tuning hyperparameters and addressing issues like exploding gradients during training</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Future Plans</h3>
      <p>As I continue to work on this project, I plan to focus on two key areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing parallelization to improve performance and handle larger datasets more efficiently. This will involve leveraging multi-threading and potentially GPU acceleration to speed up computations.</li>
        <li>Developing a robust save/load feature for model persistence. This has proven to be more challenging than initially anticipated due to the complex interplay between C++ objects and Python bindings. The main challenges involve serializing the complex C++ objects that represent the neural network architecture and weights, and ensuring that this serialized data can be correctly deserialized and reconstructed in both C++ and Python environments.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>
        This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical implementation. I'm excited to continue developing and improving this library.
