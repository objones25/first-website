            <h2>Neural Network Library Project</h2>

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>My inspiration for creating this neural network library stems from my fascination with machine learning and a desire to build on the work I did for my Math 156 Project (available <a href="https://objones25.github.io/resume_files/Math_156_Project.pdf">here</a>). In that project, I explored various machine learning methods for credit card fraud detection. This experience sparked my interest in developing a more efficient neural network implementation that could handle large datasets quickly. I saw this as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of both C++ and machine learning principles.</p>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>This project is an attempt to create a flexible and efficient neural network library that can be used for various machine learning tasks. The core implementation is in C++ for performance, with Python bindings to make it easily accessible to data scientists and machine learning practitioners.</p>

            <h3>Current Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flexible Layer class implementation</li>
                <li>Efficient feedforward and backpropagation</li>
                <li>Comprehensive training pipeline</li>
                <li>Robust debugging and logging system</li>
                <li>Support for various activation functions</li>
                <li>Multiple loss functions</li>
                <li>Weight initialization techniques</li>
                <li>Batch normalization</li>
                <li>Python bindings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p>Developing this library has come with its share of challenges, including implementing backpropagation correctly, optimizing performance, dealing with numerical stability issues, and ensuring compatibility between C++ and Python.</p>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>As I continue to work on this project, I plan to focus on implementing parallelization and developing a robust save/load feature for model persistence.</p>
